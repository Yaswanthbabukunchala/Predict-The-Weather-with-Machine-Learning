Overview
Weather forecasting is essential for agriculture, transportation, and many industries that depend on environmental stability. This project uses historical weather data to train machine learning models that predict future weather conditions with a reasonable degree of accuracy. By experimenting with multiple machine learning algorithms, we can compare and optimize these models to achieve better accuracy.

Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning of historical weather datasets
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand weather patterns
Feature engineering and selection for optimal model input
Training and evaluation of various machine learning models for weather prediction
Model optimization and tuning for improved accuracy
Visualization of prediction results for easier interpretation
Data
The project uses publicly available historical weather data, which includes variables like:

Temperature (max, min, and average)
Humidity
Wind speed
Precipitation levels
Cloud cover
Sources
National Weather Service
NOAA Climate Data
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Scaling/normalizing features
Encoding categorical data if present
Modeling
Several machine learning algorithms are used in this project:

Linear Regression - Simple and interpretable, suitable for continuous data.
Random Forest - A robust ensemble model for handling complex patterns.
XGBoost - A gradient boosting algorithm, effective for structured/tabular data.
Neural Networks - For cases with larger datasets or nonlinear relationships.
Model Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
